<div (click)="toggleContent()" class="well pointable">  
  <h4>
    <ng-content select="[well-title]"></ng-content>
  </h4>
  <ng-content *ngIf="visible" select="[well-body]"></ng-content>
</div>
<!-- Example of content projection
ng-content comes from what ever this collapsable well tag surrounds.
Specify where to get ng-content by sticking that select attribute in the tag in parent component

Essentially all this does is make a div toggleable; but it is reusable.
